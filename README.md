# ü¶¥ HOST ‚Äì Human Osteo-Skeletal Tracking

**HOST (Human Osteo-Skeletal Tracking)** is an experimental project that combines **Intel RealSense** depth sensing with **MediaPipe Pose** to detect, track, and record human skeletal movement in real time.  
It provides a foundation for motion-analysis, biomechanics research, and later machine-learning integration.

---

## üéØ Project Goals
- Capture synchronized **color + depth** streams from an Intel RealSense camera.  
- Apply **MediaPipe Pose** to extract 33 human landmarks (x, y, z, visibility).  
- Store the processed data in **CSV** format for further analysis.  
- Build an extendable base for real-time skeleton analytics and visualization.
